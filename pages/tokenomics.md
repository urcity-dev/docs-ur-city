## UR.CITY Tokenomics

----------------

### The "Virtual CITY Token" ($VCT) 

----------------

The _Virtual CITY Token_ is the **main token** of the UR.CITY platform.   
Starting with the PoC (Proof of Concept) stage of the project, the token is issued in a web2 environment on the platform.
Later, in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage, the token will be issued on crypto networks ([Shimmer]/[IOTA]).

The _$VCT_ is a rewarding token that is used to reward users for various social participations within communities and organizations and/or for their contributions to the platform.  
As a utility token, the _$VCT_ is used to pay for the use of the platform and its services.

### The "IM COMMUNITY Token" ($IMCT)

----------------

The _$IMCT_ is a **community token** that is distributed for free using various distribution mechanisms developed within the [CityOS] ecosystem..

The idea behind the _$IMCT_ is to provide the project community with the ability to decide their own utility scenarios and use them to reward the members for their participation to the community.

The token will be distributed to the community members using [CityOS] distribution tools until a consistent amount of tokens is in the community hands so a decision can be made in the community for the future steps regarding the community governance and token utility.   
At that moment, the remaining amount of tokens will be handed over to the community for further use.

The _$IMCT_ token will be issued on the [Shimmer] Network.



{: .note }
>During 2022 a certain amount of _$IMCT_ was distributed for free to the community using various mechanisms.
> The distribution will be resumed after the PoC stage.

{: .note }
>Currently, it is not decided if the _$IMCT_ will be issued and distributed under the [IM.CITY] or [UR.CITY] platform.
>A decision is made after the PoC stage.
