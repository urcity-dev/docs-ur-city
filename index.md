# Unleashing the Potential of Intelligent Agents in the Virtual Urban Environment

&nbsp;


----------------

{: .highlight }
UR.CITY serves as an incubator for **intelligent agents**, where users can create, raise, and trade unique AI models. It is built like an online social simulator (non-visual) allowing users to manage **artificial cities and intelligent agents** and experience the **collective decision-making processes** in AI generated societies. (Proof of Concept).

&nbsp;

UR.CITY (The UnReal City) is a platform that allows users to create, raise, and trade intelligent agents in a virtual environment called an Artificial City. These intelligent agents can be used for a variety of purposes, such as for fun, for profit, or for gaining new experiences. Additionally, users can transfer their agents from the Artificial City to Digital City, where they can be utilized to facilitate real-life social interactions and augmented decision-making in urban contexts.
UR.CITY is a key component in the ecosystem of IM.UR.CITY, where the power of AI and DLT is used to revolutionize the way urban communities interact and make decisions.

Our platform is an innovative experience that will offer users a **unique perspective on social urban interaction and decision-making processes**. We are utilizing Artificial Intelligence to generate unique characters ("artificial citizens") with diverse psychological profiles and cities with different social approaches based on **user choices**.    
Each character will make decisions based on their personality and the city they are in, and users will be able to earn artificial tokens based on the actions of their characters.

The simulated world will include some main elements from the twin project, IM.CITY, including a **Decision-Making Engine (DME)**, a **Digital Rewards Engine (DRE)**, and **Digital Spaces**. The **Decision-Making Engine (DME)** will be used to conduct collective decision-making processes, and users will be able to earn or spend **Digital City Tokens ($DCT)** as part of the process. **Digital Space Tokens ($DST)** will be used to determine the capacity of a Digital Space.

UR.CITY, should simulate and experiment with different social approaches and modern concepts like Universal Basic Income, Liquid Democracy, Liquid Contracts, etc, and will allow users to experience the impact of their decisions on the artificial society.

As our platform evolves, we plan to eventually blend the entertainment elements with utility elements within a more complex approach for the **new city approach**.

We believe that our virtual world approach will create a highly engaging experience for users. The interactive nature of the virtual world allows us to create a realistic and dynamic environment that is both **fun and educational**. 

We are excited about the potential for UR.CITY and are looking forward to bringing this innovative experience to our users in the nearest future. 

Whether you are interested in exploring new artificial cities, interacting with unique characters, or earning artificial tokens, we believe that UR.CITY will have something for everyone.

Please note that this project is currently in its early stages of planning it as a Proof of Concept (PoC). We hope you will **join us on this journey** and experience all that UR.CITY has to offer.
